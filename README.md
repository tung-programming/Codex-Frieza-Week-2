Responsive Design: A beautiful, responsive UI that works on all devices.

Scalable Architecture: A decoupled frontend and backend for better maintainability and scalability.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Frontend: React (with Vite)

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Image Handling: Multer for uploads, Sharp for processing

Styling: (Planned) Tailwind CSS for the frontend

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

npm or yarn

PostgreSQL installed and running

A code editor like VS Code

1. Clone the Repository
   git https://github.com/tung-programming/Codex-Frieza-Week-2
   cd root-directory name

2. Backend Setup (server/)
   Navigate to the server directory:

cd server

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up the database:

Connect to your PostgreSQL instance using a tool like pgAdmin.

Create a new database (e.g., image_gallery_db).

Run the SQL script located at server/models/db.sql to create all the necessary tables.

Create and configure the environment file:

Create a file named .env in the server/ directory.

Copy the contents from the example below and replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.

# Server Port

PORT=5001

# Database Connection (PostgreSQL)

DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=image_gallery_db
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_PORT=5432 # Or the port your DB is running on

# JWT Secret Key (generate a long, random string)

JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

Run the backend server:

npm run dev

The API will be running at http://localhost:5001.

3. Frontend Setup (client/)
   Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the client directory:

cd client

Install dependencies:

npm install

(Optional) Create an environment file: If your API is running on a different URL in production, you can create a .env file in the client/ directory.

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001

Run the frontend development server:

npm run dev

The application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:5173.
